# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

VAULT-KIT handles the most sensitive moments in human life — times of loss, grief, and crisis. Everyone who contributes to this project commits to honoring that sacred trust.

## Sensitivity First

### Remember Who Uses This

Our users are often:
- Families who have just lost a loved one
- Community members supporting the bereaved
- Volunteers serving during difficult times

Every line of code, every word of documentation, every design decision should be made with this in mind.

### Language Matters

When writing code, documentation, or content:

**Use** | **Instead of**
--------|---------------
"time after passing" | "hours from death"
"the departed" or "their loved one" | "the body"
"final resting place" | "disposal location"
"those who carry" | "pallbearers" (where culturally appropriate)
"returned to their Lord" | "expired"

### Cultural Reverence

- Religious rituals are sacred. Describe them with respect, not just as processes.
- Never reduce spiritual practices to mere "tasks" or "workflows"
- Acknowledge that practices vary — what is obligatory in one tradition may be prohibited in another
- When uncertain, consult with community members before making assumptions

## Technical Standards with Heart

### Privacy is Dignity

- Protect data as if it were shared in confidence
- Remember: a family trusting us with their loved one's information is an act of faith
- Never add features that trade privacy for convenience

### Accessibility is Inclusion

- Families in grief may have limited capacity — interfaces should be simple
- Support right-to-left languages (Arabic, Urdu, Hebrew)
- Consider offline access — hospitals and masjids may have poor connectivity

### Testing with Care

- Test data should be obviously fictional
- Never use real names, real scenarios, or real cultural examples in test cases
- Consider the impact on developers who repeatedly interact with death-related content

## Community Interactions

### Be Kind

- Contributors and users may be personally affected by the content
- Disagreements about religious practice should be handled with scholarly humility
- "I believe differently" is not the same as "you are wrong"

### Acknowledge Grief

- Some contributors may join because they experienced loss themselves
- Be patient with those who are processing while contributing
- It's okay to step away when content becomes too heavy

### Credit Communities

- When adding support for a new tradition, involve members of that community
- Do not add community overlays without community input
- Properly acknowledge the scholars and traditions from which guidance comes

## When Contributing Content

### For Religious Content

1. **Source authentically** — Cite scholars, texts, and traditions
2. **Note variations** — Different communities practice differently
3. **Stay humble** — Mark opinions as opinions, not facts
4. **Seek review** — Have community members verify accuracy

### For Technical Content

1. **Explain the "why"** — Help others understand the privacy rationale
2. **Consider the worst day** — Would this work when someone is grieving?
3. **Keep it simple** — Complexity is the enemy of crisis usability

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter conduct that violates these principles, or content that is insensitive or inaccurate, please report it to the maintainers. We take these concerns seriously.

## Enforcement

Maintainers will address violations with:
1. Private conversation to understand context
2. Request for correction or removal
3. In serious cases, removal of the contribution
4. Pattern violations may result in contributor restrictions

## A Final Word

This project exists to reduce suffering during the hardest moments of life. Every contributor is part of that mission. Let us conduct ourselves with the dignity our users deserve.
