## What Needs to Happen

In Islamic tradition, we honor our loved ones by preparing them quickly and with dignity. Here is what typically happens:

### ☐ Immediate (Now)

- [ ] **Say the du'a**: "Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un"
- [ ] **Inform immediate family** — parents, spouse, children, siblings
- [ ] **Contact your local masjid** — they can help coordinate
- [ ] **Notify your community's janazah committee** (if one exists)

### ☐ Very Soon (First Few Hours)

- [ ] **Arrange for ghusl (washing)** — The masjid can connect you with trained volunteers
- [ ] **Secure burial plot** — Contact your local Islamic cemetery
- [ ] **Inform the Imam** — To lead the funeral prayer
- [ ] **Designate a family coordinator** — Someone to answer calls and messages

### ☐ Before the Janazah Prayer

- [ ] **Ghusl completed** — Ritual washing by trained same-gender volunteers
- [ ] **Takfeen completed** — Shrouding in white cloth
- [ ] **Prayer time announced** — Community informed of location and time
- [ ] **Cemetery prepared** — Grave ready for burial

### ☐ After Burial

- [ ] **Accept condolences** — Community will visit to offer comfort
- [ ] **Accept meals** — Let others bring food; do not host
- [ ] **Rest** — Grief is exhausting; give yourself permission to rest

## You Do Not Need to Do This Alone

Your community wants to help. Let them.

**The Prophet ﷺ said**: *"Prepare food for the family of Ja'far, for there has come to them that which preoccupies them."*

People may offer help but not know how. You can say:
- "Could you coordinate meal deliveries for us?"
- "Could you help spread the announcement?"
- "Could you arrange transport for family members?"

## Caring for Yourself

Grief is natural. The Prophet ﷺ wept when his son Ibrahim passed away and said:

*"The eyes shed tears and the heart grieves, but we do not say anything except what pleases our Lord. Indeed, O Ibrahim, we are grieved by your departure."*

It is okay to cry. It is okay to feel lost. It is okay to need help.

*May Allah grant you patience, and may He grant your loved one mercy and Jannatul Firdaus.*

*Ameen.*
