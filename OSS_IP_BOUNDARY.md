# PROJ OSS/IP Boundary Policy

**Version**: 1.0  
**License**: MIT (for OSS components)  
**Date**: January 2026

---

## 1. Purpose

Vault-Kit is an **open standard/toolkit** within the SYNTHAI ecosystem.

This policy defines what is **Open Source (MIT)** vs **Proprietary IP**.

---

## 2. Guiding Principles

1.  **Standardization requires openness.** The core schemas, protocols, and reference implementations are MIT.
2.  **Interoperability over lock-in.** Data and logic must be portable.
3.  **Trust & scale are product value.** Enterprise-grade controls and hosted infrastructure are commercial.

---

## 3. What is OSS (MIT)

### A) The Core
- Core Specifications & Schemas
- Reference Implementations (SDKs, CLIs)
- Basic Adapters & Integrations
- Local-first tooling

### B) Validation & Conformance
- Test vectors
- Validators
- Conformance suites

### C) Education
- Documentation
- Tutorials & Examples

---

## 4. What is Proprietary IP (Arangam Platform)

### A) Hosted / Managed Services
- Hosted Infrastructure
- Multi-tenant SaaS
- Sync & Collaboration layers

### B) Verified Assets (The "Castle")
- **Canon Personas**: Hand-crafted, culturally grounded personas (MBS, LIFE, CORE)
- **Wisdom Overlays**: Verified semantics for Kural/VOW
- **Premium Datasets**: Curated training data or benchmarks

### C) Enterprise Control Plane
- SSO / SAML / RBAC
- Compliance & Audit Logs
- SLA & Support

---

## 5. Trademarks

Even when code/spec is MIT:

- **Trademarks are not granted**
- Names and logos are protected
- You may implement freely but may not claim "official" status without permission

---

## 6. The Boundary Rule of Thumb

> **If it defines the standard or enables local usage → OSS (MIT)**
>
> **If it provides hosted trust, verified content, or enterprise governance → Proprietary IP**
