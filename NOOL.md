# நூல் / NOOL — VAULT-KIT

> *The Reasoning Thread: a record of INTENT (why), ABSTRACTION (what type), and CHAIN (how).*

## நோக்கம் / Intent (Soul: WHY)

"Built to reveal less while helping more." VAULT-KIT is the Privacy Protocol for crisis coordination. It bridges the gap between privacy and utility through five non-negotiable properties: Verified, Auditable, Unleakable, Limited, Traceable. Completes the governance triad: NOOL (Think) → DMG (Decide) → VAULT (Protect).

## வடிவம் / Abstraction (Mind: WHAT TYPE)

**DESIGN**: A 3-layer architecture (Community Examples → Coordination Protocol → VAULT Core). Community overlays (Janazah, Shiva, etc.) sit atop a universal coordination protocol, all secured by immutable privacy infrastructure. Plane separation ensures no cross-plane access. ZK-Dissent enables hash-verified anonymous dissent with DMS integration.

## சங்கிலி / Chain (Body: HOW)

TypeScript implementation. MCP Privacy Sentinel with `check_access` and `log_access` tools. Wisdom Gate for consent-managed Kural access. GAUGE integration for 100% Heptagon compliance. Apache 2.0 licensed. The protocol is free, ARANGAM provides managed hosting.
